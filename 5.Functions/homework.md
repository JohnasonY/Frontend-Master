# Function Usage

1. Use some of the above functions to implement Goldbach’s Conjecture:
Any even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
For example: 8 = 3 + 5.
Ask the user to enter an integer greater than 2, and output which two prime numbers sum up to it.

2. Ask the user to enter a year, then output the number of days in each month of that year.

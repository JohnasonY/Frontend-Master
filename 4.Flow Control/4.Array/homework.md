1. Prompt the user to enter the length of an array and each element’s value, then print the array.

2. Initialize a numeric array and calculate the sum of all its elements.

3. Initialize a numeric array and print out all the odd numbers in the array.

4. Initialize a numeric array and print out all the prime numbers in the array.

5. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …
The first two numbers are 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
Prompt the user to enter the length of the Fibonacci sequence, and print the sequence of that length.

6. Define an array of users, where each user is an object containing a username and password. Initialize some users, then prompt the user to enter a username and password, and determine whether the login is successful.

7. Initialize a 5×5 two-dimensional array of numbers, and calculate the sum of its diagonals.

8. Initialize a numeric array (with arbitrary values), sort the array in ascending order, and then print the result.
Hint: One way to do this is with the Bubble Sort algorithm:
- Compare adjacent elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.
- Repeat this for each adjacent pair from start to end. The largest element will "bubble" to the end.
- Repeat the process for all elements except those already sorted.

9. Given an array of numbers, find the number that appears most frequently.
